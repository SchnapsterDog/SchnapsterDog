Hello, I'm [Oliver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-trajceski-8a28b070/), and I specialize in creating powerful, responsive, and modern Single Page Applications (SPA), Static Site Generators (SSG), and Server-Side Rendered (SSR) applications, from development to production.

My expertise lies in Front-end technologies such as Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and other custom Vue-based frameworks, as well as Back-end technologies such as Laravel, CodeIgniter, and various headless CMS platforms like Prismic CMS, FlexiCMS, PyroCMS, and Strapi.

In 2020, I created [IMG Force](https://imgforce.com), a global platform that enables users to upload images quickly and provides real-time optimization. I am also a co-author of [Discover Ohrid](https://discoverohrid.mk/), the first interactive travel guide that accompanies travelers in their journey to discover Ohrid - The City of Light, available on [Google Play](Discover Ohrid) and [Apple Store](Discover Ohrid).

At the end of 2022, I developed [vue-marquee-slider](https://vue-marquee.com/), a component for Vue that allows users to create customizable marquees with just a few lines of code. This simple and user-friendly tool is easy to use and can be customized to fit the needs of any project. At the beginning of 2023 I worked and created [vue-preloader](https://vue-preloader.com/), The Ultimate Solution for Fast Loading Screens.

Recently I created [nuxt-chatgpt](https://github.com/SchnapsterDog/nuxt-chatgpt), a Nuxt 3 module for ChatGPT integration.

Additionally, I am actively developing various nuxt.js modules as I am passionate about making the web a better place. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to achieve this goal, so please do not hesitate to contact me if you want to learn more about my current projects.
