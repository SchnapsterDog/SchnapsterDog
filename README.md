## Servus! :wave:

Hi there! I'm [Oliver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-trajceski-8a28b070/) and I'm a CEO/Founder and Senior Full-stack developer at [Akrinum OÜ‬](https://akrinum.com). I am creating and deploying powerful, responsive, and modern SPA, SSG and SSR applications from development to the production stage.

I am skilled in Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and other custom Vue based frameworks on the Front-end side, and Laravel, CodeIgniter, and various headless CMS (Prismic CMS, FlexiCMS, PyroCMS, Strapi) on the Back-end side.

In 2020, I created [IMG Force](https://imgforce.com), a global platform that enables users to upload images quickly and provides real-time optimization. I am also a co-author of [Discover Ohrid](https://discoverohrid.mk/), the first interactive travel guide that accompanies travelers in their journey to discover Ohrid - The City of Light, available on [Google Play](Discover Ohrid) and [Apple Store](Discover Ohrid).

Recently, at the end of 2022, I developed [vue-marquee-slider](https://vue-marquee.com/), a component for Vue that allows users to create customizable marquees with just a few lines of code. This simple and user-friendly tool is easy to use and can be customized to fit the needs of any project.

Additionally, I am actively developing various nuxt.js modules as I am passionate about making the web a better place. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to achieve this goal, so please do not hesitate to contact me if you want to learn more about my current projects.
