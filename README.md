## Servus! :wave:

Hi there! I'm [Oliver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-trajceski-8a28b070/) and I'm a CEO/Founder and Senior Full-stack developer at [Akrinum OÜ‬](https://akrinum.com). I am creating and deploying powerful, responsive, and modern SPA, SSG and SSR applications from development to the production stage.

I am skilled in Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and other custom Vue based frameworks on the Front-end side, and Laravel, CodeIgniter, and various headless CMS (Prismic CMS, FlexiCMS, PyroCMS, Strapi) on the Back-end side

In 2020 I built [IMG Force](https://imgforce.com), a user-friendly global platform for image upload, fast image CDN, real-time image optimization, and I am Co-author of [Discover Ohrid](https://discoverohrid.mk/), the first interactive travel guide to accompany you along your way to discovering Ohrid – The City of Light which is available on [Google Play](Discover Ohrid) and [Apple Store](Discover Ohrid).

At the end of 2022 I built [vue-marquee-slider](https://vue-marquee.com/), a simple and easy-to-use component for Vue that allows you to create customizable marquees with just a few lines of code.

Last but not least, I'm actively developing couple of nuxt.js modules. I'm passionate about making the web a better place, and I'm always looking for new ways to do so. If you're interested in learning more about what I'm working on, don't hesitate to reach out!
